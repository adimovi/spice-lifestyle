          <p className='mb-0'>When a customer purchases a high end brand polo shirt for $80, here is the approximate break down:
           Gross Margin to the brand of approx 70% = 56 Euro, which means that the manufacturing cost is $14 maximum, but it could be less because the brand nameâ€™s gross margin might not include shipping costs.</p>
          <p>They are also operating on a net margin of approximately 25%, which means that their operating costs including marketing, stores, staff, import taxes and logistics are about 45%/ $36 of the value of the shirt.</p>
          <p className='mb-0'>We have purchased and analysed the material and manufacturing quality of imitation counterfeit high end branded polo shirts in certain countries, and here are our findings:</p>
          <p className='mb-0'>Quality of material and manufacturing is the exact same as the branded models.</p>
          <p>Cost in the street markets was $12, which implies they must be manufacturing them for $6 to $8?</p>
          <p className='mb-0'>Due to the fact that we will spend zero on marketing because we already have our own audience of members from other Spice Lifestyle businesses and even free showrooms, we believe we can sell that same quality $80 polo shirt for $35, which includes the cost of shipping to our fulfilment centres, which will be adjacent to our grocery fulfilment centres, import taxes, plus the delivery to the customer, and still retain a 40% net margin, but on a $35 item, not an $80 item, which is a margin of  $14.</p>
