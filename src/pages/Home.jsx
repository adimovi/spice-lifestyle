              <p>I have created quite a few businesses over the past few decades, which led me to continuously travel the world. Having a very curious mind, I am continuously observing a lot of trends and human nature across different cultures, and I am always asking myself if there isnâ€™t a better way to execute certain tasks in any situation.</p>
              <p>I handed over the reins of my main business to my eldest son three years ago, and I decided to spend my time designing new concepts which have global potential, using my travel observations and proven design skills.</p>
              <p>After conducting a lot of research across various industries, my plan is to find a compatible investor, who would like to work with me towards launching the products and services I have designed, as long as they have a similar business philosophy as my own.</p>
              <p className='mb-0'>My plan is to steer the ship in the right direction towards the point of launch of all concepts, and then to let people far more capable than myself to take over from there.</p>
